# ToDoApp
Node.js implementation of simple Todo list App.
This web app allows you to add/delete items to list and create a new lists on the fly.

# Custom lists
By default a list with current date will be available on the root route, but if u need seperate custom lists, then just append the name of the custom list to the URL and there you go.

Eg. To create a new custom list called 'work' URL becomes --> http://localhost:3000/work (Assumes hosted locally with port 3000)

# Database
This app uses MongoDB as its database.
